            <strong>Amid rapid globalisation, sports are not considered to be a hobby or an extracurricular activity anymore. Rather, it is now a viable career path for those who show interest in different types of sports and work on it. The Sports School is India’s only center that focuses on a sports-driven academic curriculum so that our students can receive training and mentorship in the sport of their choice from a young age and then shaping them into professionals in the game without ever compromising on the quality of academia.</strong>

            “Around 25 years ago, I started my career as a physical education teacher and later forayed into the world of coaching and education. Since then, I knew that my life’s purpose was not just to build a foundation of excellence in sports but also laying the path for achievers who have the potential to become Olympians and world class athletes. The Sports School is a unique convergence of academics with sports to achieve competence that matches global standards to ensure sustainability in athletes. Our belief is to impart training and mentorship of the highest standards to build confidence while enabling and empowering each sportsperson to achieve higher degrees of mental and physical composure. We also support and encourage athletes that want to pursue their training, but without letting go of their education, in hopes of changing the sports industry for the better.”
